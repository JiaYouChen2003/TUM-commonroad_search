commonroad_search Documentation
=====================================

Finding safe motions in complex traffic situation is one of the major challenges in autonomous driving. Typically, one has to develop a large software framework before one can start developing new motion planning techniques---such a framework typically includes software for representing a road network, reasoning on such a network, collision checking, simulating vehicle dynamics, and visualizing results, to name only a few aspects. All this is taken care of by our CommonRoad software framework available from https://commonroad.in.tum.de. 

To further facilitate the use of CommonRoad, we have developed new helper functions that are tailored for the search algorithms. A special feature of the CommonRoad website is that you can upload your solutions and see how well you perform to other groups.
